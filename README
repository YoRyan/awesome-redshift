Redshift for Awesome WM
=======================

This is a tiny Lua library to interface the Awesome window manager with
redshift, a program that dims the screen to make it easier on your eyes,
especially at night.

What makes this any more useful than *gtk-redshift*, you might ask? Well, it
offers the following features:

* Integration with awesome via lua wrapper functions. Toggling redshift
  with a keyboard shortcut? Automatically undimming the screen when launching
  the photo editor? Now anything is possible.

* Support for multiple monitor setups that don't use xrandr. If you're
  multiheading graphics cards, this is a must-have.

* Automatic, periodic brightness adjustments. (Well, redshift offers this out
  of the box, but I thought it was worth mentioning the library takes care of
  this for you.)

When designing this library, I followed the KISS principle. I wrote convenient
wrapper functions to do the dirty work for you. It's up to *you* to program
your own keybindings, bells, and whistles.

Install
-------

In your awesome configuration directory:

`git clone git://github.com/YoRyan/awesome-redshift.git redshift`

In your rc.lua:

    local redshift = require("redshift")`

    -- set binary path (optional)
    redshift.redshift = "/usr/bin/redshift"
    -- set additional redshift arguments (optional)
    redshift.options = "-c ~/.config/redshift.conf"
    -- 1 for dim, 0 for not dimmed
    redshift.init(1)
`

Usage
-----

Done! Now you have these functions at your disposal:

* redshift.dim()
* redshift.undim()
* redshift.toggle()

(They're pretty self-explanatory...)
